My PhD studies involves benchmarking a deep learning tool (AlphaFold-Multimer) and optimizing it to drive biological discoveries. This project involves automating the preparation of input files for prediction by the deep learning tool, as well as the processing of the prediction result and subsequent downstream analyses and visualization. The preparation of input files and processing of prediction result utilize object-oriented programming (OOP) written using Python, while the downstream analyses and visualization are done using Jupyter notebook.
